UPDATE ON FLASH FLOODS IN NKHOTAKOTA AND KARONGA DISTRICTS 
The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) in the Office of the President and Cabinet would like to update the general public on effects of flash floods following heavy downpour in Nkhotakota  and Karonga Districts. 
As of Thursday, 29th February, 2024, an updated preliminary report from Nkhotakota District Council indicates that about 7,000 people have been displaced and nine camps set in Traditional Authorities (T/As) Kanyenda and Mphonde.The report further states that one person has died when the canoe they were sailing in capsized due to high water levels.
Meanwhile, a national search and rescue (SAR) team led by the Malawi Defence Force (MDF) is working with  communities in providing life-saving interventions. So far, over 900 people who were trapped in various areas, have been rescued. The SAR team is also ferrying relief items (which include maize flour and tents) earlier dispatched by the department and medical personnel and supplies/equipment to areas that require urgent attention.
For the past 24 hours, rains persisted around Dwangwa; causing widespread damage to roads and further hindering essential service delivery. 
Immediate Needs
The council further reports that displaced communities are in need of food, clothing, shelter materials (i.e family tents), blankets, dignity kits and WASH facilities (cups, pails, water treatment chemicals and mobile toilets).   
In Karonga, a brief update by the council indicates that heavy rains persisted and have largely damaged rice fields in TA Mwakawoko.
As most parts of the lakeshore areas continue experiencing high rainfalls, the department reiterate calls for communities to move to safer and higher areas.
The general public will be duly updated on damages caused by the floods and any related development.  
For more information, please contact the Principal Information Management and Public Relations Officer, Mr. Chipiliro Raymond Khamula, on +265 (0) 999 043 228, (0) 884 572 844 E-mail; info.dodma@dodma.gov.mw.

Some people that were displaced by floods in Nkhotakota district and are staying in camps have called for support to relocate upland in recovery, emphasizing that their land is no longer suitable for settlement.
Speaking today at Kanyenda camp in the district, a representative of the people, Edward Imedi, said identification of new land and payment of relevant costs need to be considered as officials plan for the recovery support.
He was speaking when NBS bank donated some relief items to flood survivors at the camp.
Nkhotakota District Council Director of Administration and Human Resource Victor Chithabwa, said the council is now targeting households in provision of relief support as part of preparations for decommissioning of the camps.
The support which the NBS bank has donated is valued at over four million kwacha.

This is a house of a teacher at Chauma Primary School which has been temporarily closed due to floods in Nkhotakota district.
The government owned Junior Primary School was opened in 1995 according to Headmaster, Dustan Kwacha.
It has three makeshift houses and one which was constructed using cement bricks.
Kwacha says two houses of this nature were constructed under the School Improvement Grant - SIG to reduce the challenge of shortage of teacher houses.
There is also a borehole which was submerged in water during the floods but is now being used although the headmaster says sometimes frogs have been coming out together with water meant for drinking.

The district was severely impacted by floods just over a week ago, following a downpour of torrential rain that persisted for over two days.

As part of the inspection, His Excellency also paid a visit to Illovo Sugar Plant in Dwangwa, where the sugar manufacturer has set up a temporary relief camp, within its compound, for the victims surrounding the area and beyond.
Addressing the victims at the camps and a crowd that gathered at Dwangwa Trading Centre, His Excellency, offered hope and re-assurance but emphasized that the Nkhotakota floods and other natural calamities of this scale affect everyone, and as such require a unified front in addressing the aftermath of such disasters.
President Chakwera also called on more effort to be invested in climate change resilience including in the form of creating infrastructure like roads and bridges that can withstand future natural shocks.

Hundreds of people that were affected by floods at Chauma and Kachere in Nkhotakota district are still staying in their areas which are considered as disaster prone sites by some officials.
Some of the people told us today they cannot move upland despite the fact that they lost property during the floods as they  need to protect their land, livestock and other remaining property.

A representative of the people, Andrew Mzembe, said they feel abandoned as no one has visited them for any support  before the visit by the parliamentarian.

Acting Distaster and Risk Management Officer for Nkhotakota District Council, George Zibophe, called on well-wishers, companies, and various organisations to continue assisting with urgent needs those that have been affected.
Zibophe said there are plans to fully support the recent flash flood survivors in readiness for decommissioning of the camps.
""We are registering those that have been affected and the government through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) is planning to distribute relief items to each and every household to assist them when they return to their communities,"" said Zibophe.
Village Headman Semion Kanyenda welcomed the plans by the district council, adding that the donation they have received from Ripple Africa has come at the camp at the right time.
Some of the people at the camp were staying at Matiki and Nyavuwu Primary Schools but have been moved to Ngala, for provision of education to continue in the public education facilities in the district.
