Ripple Africa bails out flood survivors in Nkhotakota
Nkhotakota, March 14: Ripple Africa on Wednesday donated assorted relief items to the recent flash flood survivors sheltered in three camps at a non-operational private secondary school at Ngala in the area of Senior Chief Kanyenda in Nkhotakota.
Ripple Africa District Project Coordinator Getrude Odala said being part of a development partner in the district, they felt it was necessary to assist people that have been affected by the recent floods in the district.
She said they have provided food, non-food and sanitary items, including maize flour, cooking oil, sugar, soap and tents all valued at K5 million to ease the stay of the survivors at the camp.
""We have made the donation after our concern with the disaster which has affected people, and we hope that the items will address some of the challenges which are being faced here,"" said Odala.
Acting Distaster and Risk Management Officer for Nkhotakota District Council, George Zibophe, called on well-wishers, companies, and various organisations to continue assisting with urgent needs those that have been affected.
Zibophe said there are plans to fully support the recent flash flood survivors in readiness for decommissioning of the camps.
""We are registering those that have been affected and the government through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) is planning to distribute relief items to each and every household to assist them when they return to their communities,"" said Zibophe.
Village Headman Semion Kanyenda welcomed the plans by the district council, adding that the donation they have received from Ripple Africa has come at the camp at the right time.
Some of the people at the camp were staying at Matiki and Nyavuwu Primary Schools but have been moved to Ngala, for provision of education to continue in the public education facilities in the district.

Hundreds of people that were affected by floods at Chauma and Kachere in Nkhotakota district are still staying in their areas which are considered as disaster prone sites by some officials.
Some of the people told us today they cannot move upland despite the fact that they lost property during the floods as they  need to protect their land, livestock and other remaining property.
Today member of parliament Henry Chimunthu Banda visited the areas which have a public primary school called Chauma to provide humanitarian support.
A representative of the people, Andrew Mzembe, said they feel abandoned as no one has visited them for any support  before the visit by the parliamentarian.
But John Manda who is one of the leaders at Nkhotakota District Council in the disaster response operation says all people in the areas were moved upland  adding that those who are remaining, are doing that on their own wish.

Leader of the Democratic Progressive Party - DPP in parliament, Mary Navicha today visited Katimbila and Senjere camps of people that are homeless due to floods in Nkhotakota district.
The people including Ireen Kasiya of Senjere camp expressed worry over what they called ""limited humanitarian support"" they are getting from  government since the disaster occurred.
They said for instance, 13 bags of maize and two tins of Usipa have been provided for Katimbila camp of over 1000 affected people prompting them to share maize flour in a cup to prepare meals.
In her remarks, Navicha accused government of lacking seriousness in the disaster response wondering why no cabinet minister visited the affected people so far.
""I would want to call upon the government to immediately come and provide support to the affected people here. This is not the time to be snoring in offices whilst our friends here are suffering. It's time to jack up and show leadership at all concerned levels"", said.

People that are being accommodated at Katimbila camp in Nkhotakota district following the recent flood disaster are said to have stayed three days without taking any meal at the camp.
Ward Councillor for the area who is also the Chairperson for Nkhotakota District Council, Charles Chimzukuzuku, says this is because there was a disagreement on provision of some food items  some days ago which prompted the council to suspend provision of any support to the camp.
We understand that a truck carrying bags of maize was returned as some community members that were not affected by the floods wanted to receive the maize together with those staying at the camp, prompting some council officials to take  the maize to another camp.
As the disagreement has now been resolved, the Malawi Gaming and Lotteries Authority has today donated relief items valued at five million kwacha.

The health office in Nkhotakota says 15 cases of conjunctivitis disease have been registered in camps that are accommodating flood survivors at Dwangwa in the district.   
Director of Health Services in the district, Dr. Jacob Kafulafula, says people suffering from the disease which is also known as “pink eye” have since been isolated to control its spread.
“We have also encouraged people to use hygiene measures such as washing hands and not sharing utensils”, said Dr. Kafulafula adding that clinical services are being offered in the camps.  
He however expressed concern over the tendency of using traditional medicines to treat the disease saying this is leading to some complications.
A total of 116 cases of the disease have been registered in health facilities of the district namely Nkhunga, Matiki, Ngala and Mtosa according to Dr. Kafulafula.

This is a house of a teacher at Chauma Primary School which has been temporarily closed due to floods in Nkhotakota district.
The government owned Junior Primary School was opened in 1995 according to Headmaster, Dustan Kwacha.
It has three makeshift houses and one which was constructed using cement bricks.
Kwacha says two houses of this nature were constructed under the School Improvement Grant - SIG to reduce the challenge of shortage of teacher houses.
There is also a borehole which was submerged in water during the floods but is now being used although the headmaster says sometimes frogs have been coming out together with water meant for drinking.

"38","#ZBSNews Parliamentarian for Nkhotakota North Constituency, Henry Chimunthu Banda has called on government to consider bailing out Dwangwa based business operators who lost property worth millions of kwacha in the recent floods through initiatives such as provision of loans. The member of parliament told us today after visiting floods survivors at Nkhunga Community Day Secondary School Camp that some people were operating large scale businesses such as lodges, garages and restaurants which have been damaged, hence the call. Meanwhile, the legislator says he is working with various stakeholders to establish temporary camps which will not disturb classes in public schools.

"87","For the past 2 weeks, since the 28th of February when flash floods hit Nkhotakota Dwangwa, we Malawi-Hilfe Schwindegg e.V. have been very busy on the ground, helping victims get to safety and providing relief items.
The biggest highlight was when we took a boat to 2  isolated camps called chauma and kachere. No one has been able to reach victims on these sites because they have been cut off from main land and the only access would be through a 1hr boat ride or Illovo farms, but unfortunately the bridge on that side has also collapsed due to floods as you may see in the pictures. Many thanks to the team from National emergency medical team(N-EMT) WHO Malawi WaruAttah Chilongo and Dr L.Mapata who joined the trip and checked on sick victims.
These 2 camps collectively hold a population of over 900 victims and need relief support immediately. We were able to distribute 50 blankets, 40 bags of flour, 10 bales of soya pieces, cooking oil, soap, salt and nutritious peanut butter for the kids.
Reaching this date, we have reached out to 13 camps namely Dwambadzi, Kasitu, Ngala, Dema, Mtupi, Nkhunga, Kanyenda, Dwangwa Masijid, Matiki, Nyamvuwu, Chauma and Kachere. Holding a collective population of over 5000 victims.
In a space of 6 days we have distributed 140 bags of flour, 100 litres cooking oil, 533 blankets, 1550 cups, 700 plates, 200 buckets, 200kgs Salt, 95 kilos bonya, 200 buckets and 366 reusable sanitary pads. 
We are calling on different organisations and the government to come and provide support to the victims. More especially, tents, mosquito nets, blankets, chlorine, medical supplies, Sanitary pads, buckets, and food rations. I understand Department of Disaster Management Affairs Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS DWANGWA ILLOVO SUGAR GROUP and many other organisations are already on the ground.
Above all, I would like to thank hon. Henry Chimunthu Banda for your rock solid support. You have been with us day and night, travelling to all the camps and providing support with your personal resources including crew, cars, fuel, food and relief items.
Thanks to Mala KayiraKondwanie ÐzekedèkéFai Malengah for driving several times between Lilongwe and Dwangwa to drop off items that we could not get from Dwangwa.
The work still continues!

"92","I got videos from my mother in Nkhotakota showing the situation with floods as of yesterday. I also watched the situation at Dwangwa on MBC TV. 
I have grown up in my home district and it's the first time in my life I have seen the whole Kaombe bridge submerged in water. The whole of it. Not even has Dwangwa ever been that covered up by water. 
Another sad part of it is that this rain, being destructive aside, is coming at a wrong time when much of the maize already withered. In terms of the staple food, this is rain that will yield nothing. Nor do I think it will help the situation for rice. The flooding is such that even the tender rice seedlings growing in the field may either be washed away or completely suffocated (to death).
In the end, Chakwera's presidency shall go down in history as a presidency that was marked, in its first term, with a whole five years of calamitous natural disasters, giving him no time to breathe and focus on building the economy. We all need to sympathise with that man. Of course, this is not the best time to say this, but I think it still has to be said at a time when people can best remember.
Anyway. My message goes to the guys at Dodma. The current Dodma Principal Secretary is from Nkhotakota, coincidentally: our very fine boy, Kaka Charles Kalemba. He is one of the few guys with a very spotless track record in civil service. An honest guy from my home. If it all depended on him, I would be assured that all the relief items that government will prepare for Nkhotakota will rich the intended beneficiaries and that all the money budgeted for this will be spent accordingly. But that is dreaming too much. The truth is that Dodma is the headquarters of pilfering in government. Anyamata osowetsa ndalama ya bokosi pa maliro. 
Anyway, Kaka Kalemba, we rely on you for this one. We do not doubt your integrity. But tell the crooked guys under your office there that ife a ku Nkhotakota tilipo ambiri ntown muno and you know we fear no politician. If we ever hear that someone has diverted relief resources meant for Nkhotakota, we shall walk to Dodama offices and set the whole of it on fire 🔥 in daylight.

Though the physical and emotional damage I have witnessed is enormous, we are already executing a multi-sectoral response plan to provide food, shelter, comfort and hope to affected communities.
My administration is already rehabilitating critical infrastructure to aid movement of people and relief items. We are also standing steady to commence renovation of all public infrastructure once the waters recede fully.
I have once again reminded the affected communities and all people of Nkhotakota to be mindful of contemporary weather patterns and become climate conscious in usage of natural resources. This is the only way of adopting climate resilience, going forward.","flooding in nkhotakota, nkhotakota floods","https://web.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=952423002921325&set=pcb.952423359587956",NA,NA,2024-03-07,"0.68611111111111112",NA

For immediate release
UPDATE ON FLASH FLOODS IN NKHOTAKOTA AND KARONGA DISTRICTS 
The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) in the Office of the President and Cabinet would like to update the general public on effects of flash floods following heavy downpour in Nkhotakota  and Karonga Districts. 
As of Thursday, 29th February, 2024, an updated preliminary report from Nkhotakota District Council indicates that about 7,000 people have been displaced and nine camps set in Traditional Authorities (T/As) Kanyenda and Mphonde.The report further states that one person has died when the canoe they were sailing in capsized due to high water levels.
Meanwhile, a national search and rescue (SAR) team led by the Malawi Defence Force (MDF) is working with  communities in providing life-saving interventions. So far, over 900 people who were trapped in various areas, have been rescued. The SAR team is also ferrying relief items (which include maize flour and tents) earlier dispatched by the department and medical personnel and supplies/equipment to areas that require urgent attention.
For the past 24 hours, rains persisted around Dwangwa; causing widespread damage to roads and further hindering essential service delivery. 
Immediate Needs
The council further reports that displaced communities are in need of food, clothing, shelter materials (i.e family tents), blankets, dignity kits and WASH facilities (cups, pails, water treatment chemicals and mobile toilets).   
In Karonga, a brief update by the council indicates that heavy rains persisted and have largely damaged rice fields in TA Mwakawoko.
As most parts of the lakeshore areas continue experiencing high rainfalls, the department reiterate calls for communities to move to safer and higher areas.
The general public will be duly updated on damages caused by the floods and any related development.  
For more information, please contact the Principal Information Management and Public Relations Officer, Mr. Chipiliro Raymond Khamula, on +265 (0) 999 043 228, (0) 884 572 844 E-mail; info.dodma@dodma.gov.mw.

"135","President Dr Lazarus Chakwera today visited and consoled recent flash flood survivors who were rendered homeless in Nkhotakota district.
Speaking at Kanyenda and Matiki primary schools in the area of Senior Chief Kanyenda where some survivors are being sheltered in camps, Chakwera assured the survivors that his government will with speed continue to assist them with the necessary support until they return to their communities.
He stressed that apart from the government, there are other development partners and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that have already started assisting them adding that others have shown interest in helping these survivors until they can safely return to their areas of residence. 
The President also called on the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) to work with speed in their assessment and  provision of the necessary help to the people in the camps. 
Parliamentarian for Nkhotakota North Constituency, Henry Chimunthu Banda, asked President Chakwera through his government to consider bailing out business operators, who lost their businesses at Dwangwa Trading Centre due to the flash floods.
Chimunthu Banda said the people who are in various camps in his area were operating large businesses citing that such people should be considered with initiatives such as the provision of loans through the National Economic and Employment Fund (NEEF) with fair payment plans so they can rebuild their businesses. 
In his remarks, Minister of Local Government Unity and Culture Richard Chimwendo Banda commended the President for visiting the flood survivors physically, adding that he is confident that the problems that the relevant authorities are facing will be addressed.
Nkhotakota has been hit with flash floods due to heavy rains that have left over 14,000 people displaced, over 10,000 in camps, six dead and two still missing, according to a preliminary report released by the district council.","nkhotakota floods",NA,NA,NA,2024-03-07,"0.84513888888888888",NA

His Excellency, Dr. Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera, President of the Republic of Malawi today offered hope to the hundreds of victims of devastating floods, when he visited some of the affected areas in Nkhotakota.
The district was severely impacted by floods just over a week ago, following a downpour of torrential rain that persisted for over two days. The unrelenting rain caused the banks of rivers to burst, subsequently destroying infrastructure including roads, bridges and homes; and more poignantly the loss of life.
His Excellency started by inspecting Mkhoma Bridge before proceeding to Dwangwa Trading Centre, which was particularly affected, where he visited one of five relief camps that were set up by authorities, to provide shelter to the victims of the disaster. So far the district  has recorded at least seven deaths as a result of the floods.
As part of the inspection, His Excellency also paid a visit to Illovo Sugar Plant in Dwangwa, where the sugar manufacturer has set up a temporary relief camp, within its compound, for the victims surrounding the area and beyond.
Addressing the victims at the camps and a crowd that gathered at Dwangwa Trading Centre, His Excellency, offered hope and re-assurance but emphasized that the Nkhotakota floods and other natural calamities of this scale affect everyone, and as such require a unified front in addressing the aftermath of such disasters.
President Chakwera also called on more effort to be invested in climate change resilience including in the form of creating infrastructure like roads and bridges that can withstand future natural shocks.
President Chakwera stated that we must learn from these disasters in order to counter the effects of reoccurrences. He added that this can only be achieved if we review the designs of infrastructure in order to make improvements.","flooding in nkhotakota, flooding in Dwangwa, nkhotakota floods, dwangwa floods","https://web.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1869721466812871&set=pcb.7411486845577310",NA,NA,2024-03-07,"0.86527777777777781",NA

The Ministry of Water and Sanitation through the Department of Water Resources, has warned the general public that there is a possibility of flooding of most rivers in the Northern and Central areas of Malawi based on the forecast by the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services.
It has been announced that that the Congo air mass coupled with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ) will be influencing the weather over central and Northern Malawi thereby causing rains associated with occasional thunderstorms over most areas.
According to a statement signed by J.N. Magwira for: Secretary for Water and Sanitation the rivers include: Songwe, North Rukuru, Kyungu and Lufilya  rivers in Karonga District, Kasitu River and South Rukuru in Rumphi, Bua, Dwangwa, Dwambadzi, Lifyodzi, and Mkhula rivers in Nkhotakota District, Lingadzi, Linthipe, and Lifidzi rivers in Salima District. A number of low lying areas of rivers in lake shore districts of Karonga, Rumphi, Nkhatabay, Nkhotakota and Salima, urban areas of Lilongwe along Lingadzi and Mchesi rivers.
The Ministry has therefore advised the general public to refrain from settling in, cultivating along the said areas during the rain, and crossing the flooded rivers and streams and to be alert when visiting the areas.","flooding in Dwangwa",NA,NA,NA,2024-02-07,NA,NA
